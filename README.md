# User Guide
1) After installing the extension, you can find the control pannel in the "N" sidebar.
2) From there, you can edit all the settings on the panel:

   The sliders go from lowest render time (lowest quality result, 0) to highest quality (maximum time, 100). 
3) When you finish picking the values, click apply settings and let the program run until the progress bar finishes. This should take any number of minutes, based on your scene.
4) It may be beneficial to open the Blender console before running the program, as it will provide progress updates. Blender may freeze if the console isn't open, but the extension will still finish.
6) The settings should automatically apply after. You can render your scene with the changes in place.
7) To reset the values back to default, click on the "Final Render Mode" button.
